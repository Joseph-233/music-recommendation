# Music Recommendation System for Runners

## Project Overview 
This Music Recommendation System is specifically designed for runners, aiming to enhance their running experience by providing song suggestions that not only align with their musical tastes but also match their running pace. By analyzing user data and song features, the system uses a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model to predict and recommend songs that runners would enjoy and that complement their workout intensity and pace.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Offers song suggestions based on individual user preferences and running pace.
- **Dynamic Feedback Loop:** Incorporates real-time user feedback to refine and improve song recommendations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Employs techniques like label encoding and feature selection to prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes LightGBM for efficient training and evaluation, focusing on accuracy and relevance of recommendations. Dataset The dataset includes user profiles with attributes such as age, average beats per minute (BPM), cadence, pace, and song metadata like track name, artist, and various musical characteristics.
